# Text classification for customer complaints using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. 

I create this project as a tutorial of a pipeline of the creation of a supervised machine learning classificator of financial customer complaints. I used the database from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which you can find [here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/)

I also used parts of the code for feature engineering and model implementation from the excellent tutorial made by Miguel Fernandez, which you can find [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-in-python-dd95d264c802).
